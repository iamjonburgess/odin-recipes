        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 cup pre-cooked white corn meal</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix water, corn meal, mozzarella cheese, butter, and salt together in a large bowl. Knead until mixed well and the dough has a soft consistency. Form balls the size of a medium orange and place them between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Flatten with a rolling pin to your desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Cut the dough into circles using a cereal bowl or drinking glass, lip-down, through the plastic wrap. Remove the plastic wrap and remove excess dough.</li>
            <li>Coat a griddle with cooking spray and heat to medium-high. Add arepas and grill until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Serve immediately.</li>
